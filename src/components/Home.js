            Dear Loggan<br />
            Happy Valentines Day baby! I hope that my website is working okay haha...
            Thank you for being the best boyfriend ever! I really appreciate you driving to come see me every day and 
            paying for our dates as well as making me laugh all the time. 
            I love you very much and I have loved getting to know you and I really hope you know I love and appreciate 
            everything you do for me. 
            Some things I find attractive about you... well for one we actually have so much in common.
            I was so excited to learn that you like Valorant and Pokemon. You are also actually kind of a romantic at heart 
            even if you dont readily admit it. Youre really funny and I admire how likable you are. Youre so determined in 
            life and I can tell youre meant to be a great dad. 
            Another thing I appreciate is that you are always thinking of my feelings and what my feelings are for you. 
            Theres not many men in the world like you and I truly believe that. I am one lucky lucky girl. 
            Thank you so much for giving me a chance and letting me get to know you. 
            I hope you feel the same way that I do and I cant wait to see what the future will be like for us!!! <br />
            I love you <br />
